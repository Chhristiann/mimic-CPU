# Project Summary:
    This project combines a class which acts like a CPU and all of its functionalities
    and my own namespace called 'cminusminus'/C-- which provides classes and functions
    for handling different data types and allows the user to enter various data types
    in various order(s).

    With the current code the user can create a local variable in main where they can
    then add/sub/mul/div numbers and concatenate a string with all data types.

### Namespace C--:
    Name stems from C++ which is a very dynamic, powerful language when I built off it
    and made it more complex then it needs to be.

### Lesson(s) Learned:
    ‣ If you touch something that semi-works, it will never work again!
    ‣ I wrote the README before the majority of the code was complete...
        undershoot some points made here.
    ‣ Working with a template, especially a class, its hard whether to create multiple
        objects or cast every single object call.
        
### CPU Class:
    This class is a template which can dynamically work with different data types.

    Contains member functions which can:
        Load
        Store
